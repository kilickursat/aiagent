## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kilickursat/aiagent.git
    cd aiagent
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. (Optional) Set up Hugging Face API key:
    - Sign up at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) if you donâ€™t have an account.
    - Get your API token [here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).
    - Add your token in the script where prompted or through environment variables.

## Configuration

The project reads settings from a `config.json` file. If the file is missing, it uses default settings. You can customize:
- Logging preferences.
- Parameters for TBM efficiency, cutter life, and maintenance factors.
- Visualization colors for soil, rock, and water.
- Safety factors and water pressure adjustments.

Example `config.json`:
```json
{
  "logging": {
    "level": "INFO",
    "format": "%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
  },
  "tbm": {
    "efficiency_factor": 0.85,
    "cutter_life": 100,
    "maintenance_factor": 0.9
  },
  "face_stability": {
    "safety_factor": 1.5,
    "water_pressure_factor": 1.2
  },
  "visualization": {
    "colors": {
      "soil": "#8B4513",
      "rock": "#808080",
      "water": "#4169E1"
    }
  }
}
```
